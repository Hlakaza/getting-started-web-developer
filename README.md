## Getting started as a web developer

This is just a guide on what can help one pivot from any career to wb development. This is purely tailored based on my experience and the people i have helped get into tech. 
If you do not agree with any of the items in this, It s okay, I am also learning  you can help by contributing suggestions.

First step if you need to move into tech, You will need to have a decent machine/laptop/desktop what ever you use. 
I suggest nothing below these specs.
Windows machine : 8gig ram I3 processor
Macbook: 8gig ram / dont think the processor matters, Depends on what you will be doing
